Git is a tool used for source code management. It is a version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.

# Why We Use Git

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.

# Terminologies

1. **Clone** - it allows you to clone the repos available on GitHub.
2. **Pull** - It pushes the changes to remote repos
3. **Push** - It fetch the changes that are done by other user on remote repo.
4. **Branches** - Branch in Git is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with your work, you can merge it with the main office.
